Using data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase, I built a model that predicts spam vs. ham emails. The dataset denotes spam (1) or ham(0) i.e (unsolicited commercial e-mail). The features are primarily related to word or character frequency and aggregate features related to uninterrupted sequences of capital letters. 


False positives here are very undesirable. We all sometimes get spam email in our inbox but marking good emails as spam is bad for business.
